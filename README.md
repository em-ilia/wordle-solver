# Wordle Solver
## About
I hate using my own brain to think, that's why I'm going to spend hours thinking about how to make my computer do this for me.

I first wrote this in Python and then ported it to C++ for fun ("fun"). 
The python version can be used by just loading `solve.py` interactively (`python -i solve.py`).
The C++ version doesn't really allow for this. You *could* add lines to `tester.cpp` and repeatedly recompile, but that'd be a huge pain.
I might come back and make some sort of interface for the C++ version, or I might not.
This was just a recreational endeavour to keep me somewhat busy.
